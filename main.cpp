/*
 The project will work by identifying the type of each chord and the interval between them.
 Ex: Am-D7-Gmaj is a ii-V-I and you can tell becuse Am-D7 is the A is minor, the D is dominant,
 and it's a perfect fourth between them.
 
 It sucks that there's a lot of mundane, dumb hard coding for these intervals but it is what it is.
 But the nice thing is that if you go by half steps it shouldn't be too bad
