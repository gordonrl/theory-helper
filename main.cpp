/*
 Part one of this project is creating an array of pairs for every key signature for
 every interval. This will make it fairly easy to identify chord changes because they are
 just intervals depending on the type of each chord.
 
 The project will work by identifying the type of each chord and the interval between them.
 Ex: Am-D7-Gmaj is a ii-V-I and you can tell becuse Am-D7 is the A is minor, the D is dominant,
 and it's a perfect fourth between them.
